**宏智正覺禪師**  
*Spacious Wisdom, True Awakening (Hongzhi Zhengjue Chanshi, Wanshi Shogaku Zenji)*

佛佛要機、祖祖機要。  
*The essential function of all buddhas, the functional essence of all ancestors:*

不觸事而知、不對縁而照。  
*Knowing without touching things, illumining without facing objects.*

不觸事而知、其知自微。  
*Knowing without touching things, the knowing is naturally subtle.*

不對縁而照、其照自妙。  
*Illumining without facing objects, the illumining is naturally wondrous.*

其知自微、曾無分別之思。  
*The knowing, naturally subtle, is ever without discriminating thought.*

其照自妙、曾無毫忽之兆。  
*The illumining, naturally wondrous, is ever without a hairsbreadth of separation.*

曾無分別之思、其知無偶而奇。  
*Ever without discriminating thought, this knowing is singular without comparison.*

曾無毫忽之兆、其照無取而了。  
*Ever without a hairsbreadth of separation, this illumining is complete without grasping.*

水清徹底兮、魚行遲遲。  
*The water is clear right through to the bottom; a fish goes slowly, slowly along.*

空闊莫涯兮、鳥飛杳杳。  
*The sky is vast without boundary; a bird flies far, far away.*
